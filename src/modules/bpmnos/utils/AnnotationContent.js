 *
 * Everything comes from the execution data registry, so the box shows exactly what a token at the node
 * carries: status, data and globals, each in declaration order, inherited entries first and the node's own
 * last. Empty compartments are dropped.
 *
 * AnnotationLayout turns this into rows and a height, and the renderer draws one compartment per entry — so
 * this is the only file to change when the box is to show more, such as operators and restrictions once the
 * registry holds them.
